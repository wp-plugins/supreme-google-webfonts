<strong>UPDATE:</strong>
After releasing this plugin, I have noticed calling the google webfont directory adds about two to three seconds to page load time.  This is because each font makes a separate call to google to access the font.  I am working on a method which will allow you to choose which fonts to include and not have to call the other, unnecessary fonts from google.

<strong>Update: (04-06-12)</strong>
I have created a MUCH better custom Google webfonts plugin.  Find out more information by clicking the link below:

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.

     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. That's it.  Go to your visual editor to begin using your google webfonts.
